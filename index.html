          <h1>Linear Search </h1>
          <p>Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.</p>

          <h1>Linked List</h1>
          <p>A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
            Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.</p>

            <div class="in-table" id="stack">
              <h1>Stack </h1>
              <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/tech" alt="" class="table-image">
              <p>A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.
                A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. For example, we can place or remove a card or plate from the top of the stack only. Likewise, Stack ADT allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack.
                This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. In stack terminology, insertion operation is called PUSH operation and removal operation is called POP operation.

              <h1>Tree </h1>
              <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/tech" alt="" class="table-image">
              <p>Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.
                Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="in-table" id="queue">
              <h1>Queue </h1>
              <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/tech" alt="" class="table-image">
              <p>Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
                A real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.
