            <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
            <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/tech" alt="" class="table-image">
            <p>Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.
                The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. Following are some of the examples of sorting in real-life scenarios</p>

            <p>A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
              Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.</p>

            <h1>Linear Search </h1>
            <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/tech" alt="" class="table-image">
            <p>Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.</p>

            <img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/tech" alt="" class="table-image">
            <p>Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.
              Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.</p>
